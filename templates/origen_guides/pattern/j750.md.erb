This page will be used to document any J750-only APIs related to pattern generation,
however the goal is to have as few of these as possible so that Origen pattern source code can re-target
automatically to any supported platform.

There are no significant APIs in this category currently, therefore refer to the
[Common Pattern API](<%= path "guides/pattern/common" %>) which can fully target the J750.
