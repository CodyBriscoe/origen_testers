# This file should be used to extend the origen command line tool with tasks 
# specific to your application.
# The comments below should help to get started and you can also refer to
# lib/origen/commands.rb in your Origen core workspace for more examples and 
# inspiration.
#
# Also see the official docs on adding commands:
#   http://origen.freescale.net/origen/latest/guides/custom/commands/

# Map any command aliases here, for example to allow origen -x to refer to a 
# command called execute you would add a reference as shown below: 
aliases = {
#  "-x" => "execute",
  "g"  => "generate"
}

# The requested command is passed in here as @command, this checks it against
# the above alias table and should not be removed.
@command = aliases[@command] || @command

# Now branch to the specific task code
case @command

# Generates a pattern model given the input file(s).
